Indian American Oncology Population Analysis from a Rural Hospital EHR

In this project, EHR data of Indian American patients diagnosed with Oncology (ICD code C00-D49) from a Rural Hospital were analyzed to understand the patient care resources and barriers in seeking oncology services. 
The analysis also differentiated the population by the tribes. The study found the patterns of diagnosis (ICD code), insurance, timing of initiation treatement and diagnosis, and especially the geographic locations were 
factors affecting the patient's access to healthcare resources.
